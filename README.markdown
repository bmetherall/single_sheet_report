## Description

An abridged version of the InFoMM lay report designed to fit on a single sheet of A4. 

## Usage

Copy the MWE example folder and then type in your lay report. Only modify the mwe.tex file. Starting the report should be as:

```
\documentclass[a4paper, 10pt, english, oneside]{extarticle}
\input{preamble}

\author{Oliver\\Sheridan-Methven} % Linebreak if you have a long name. 
\title{Some Interesting Project Title} 
\myface{sheridan_face}

\begin{document}
\maketitle 

% Start typing. 
\end{document}
```

For a fully worked example see the Roxana Pamfil example (which I created to mimic an original template based on one she produced).

### Instructions

For lay reports, please use the same title as in the signed letter of agreement. The lay report should be written in easy to understand language, with minimal jargon (all technical language to be fully explained). There should be no references and no equations (a basic formula is allowed). Please write in the present tense and use first person plural. 

The length of the document should be no greater than 2 sides of A4 and the document should contain the following:  

 1. A description of the challenge, including relevant background.
 2. A description of how you address the challenge.
 3. A description of the key results. 
 4. A description of the key conclusions (written in the context of the challenge).
 5. A statement about the potential impact of your work, including a quote from your company supervisor.
